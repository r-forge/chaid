Description: This package offers an implementation of CHAID, a type of decision tree
  technique for a nominal scaled dependent variable published in 1980 by Gordon 
  V. Kass. CHAID stands for Chi-squared Automated Interaction Detection and 
  detects interactions between categorized variables of a data set, one of which
  is the dependent variable. The remaining variables may or may not be ordered.
  An algorithm for recursive partitioning is implemented, based on maximizing the
  significance of a chi-squared statistic for cross-tabulations between the
  dependent variable and the predictors at each partition. The data are
  partitioned into mutually exclusive, exhaustive subsets that best describe the
  dependent variable. Multiway splits are used by default.
